# DoxygenGenerator
A quick way to generate API documentation from inside Unity using doxygen, with doxygen-awesome styling. Useful for generating API of your custom packages.

Note that this is a personal utility tool, not a full-blown supported package (I mean just look at this shoddy README). You may always post issues, but if there are features you'd like to see it may be wiser to fork this project. And hey, if your changes are good, contributions are always welcome!
