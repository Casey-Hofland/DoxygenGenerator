# DoxygenGenerator
A quick way to generate API documentation from inside Unity using doxygen, with doxygen-awesome styling. Useful for generating API of your custom packages.

Watch this tutorial to get started:

Note that this is a personal utility tool, not a reliably supported package (I mean just look at this shoddy README). I may make changes to the styling or code at any point without warning, so it may be best to fork this project for yourself. But hey, if you _do_ make any valuable additions, contributions are always welcome!
